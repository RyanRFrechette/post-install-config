In this project, I demonstrated my ability to effectively manage support tickets using the osTicket platform. I created and resolved various support tickets, coordinated with different teams, and managed agent access settings, showcasing my proficiency in handling helpdesk systems and providing timely resolutions to user issues.

<p>
I began by creating three distinct support tickets for various issues: a business critical outage, personal computer problems, and a general inquiry about a hardware refresh. I provided specific user information, help topics, and issue summaries for each ticket, ensuring proper categorization and prioritization.

<p>
After creating the tickets, I logged in as an agent and admin to manage and modify access settings. I selected appropriate departments and roles, such as Support and Supreme Admin, and saved the changes. I then logged in as an agent again to address the tickets, updating their priority levels, assigning them to the proper agents, and modifying their departments as needed.

<p>
To resolve the business critical outage ticket, I coordinated with the System Admin team, updated the ticket with the steps taken to address the issue, and marked it as resolved. For the personal computer issues ticket, I assigned it to another agent, who then took the necessary steps to resolve the problem.

</p>
<p>
For the general inquiry ticket, I provided information about the hardware refresh, assigned the ticket to myself, and marked it as resolved. I then logged in as another agent to review the personal computer issues ticket and added an internal note describing the resolution. I also logged in as an admin to modify access settings for department members.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Lastly, I logged in as another agent to resolve the personal computer issues ticket, updated the ticket status, and posted a reply. I then reviewed the Closed tab to confirm the resolution of all three tickets. This project highlights my ability to efficiently manage and resolve support tickets using a helpdesk platform, ensuring prompt and effective solutions for users.
